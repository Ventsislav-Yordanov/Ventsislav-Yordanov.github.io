Machine learning is a **scientific field** in which the people are using computer power to train algorithms. The **algorithms are trained** to perform a specific task effectively **without using explicit instructions**. They're trained on a subset data, also known as "training data" in order to make **predictions** or decisions. They're used in a wide variety of applications, such as face recognition, recommender systems, email filtering, autonomous cars, fraud detection and so on.
