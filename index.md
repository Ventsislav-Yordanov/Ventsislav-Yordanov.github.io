# Welcome!
This web application is all about **data science** and **machine learning**. I'll try to take **notes** about important terms in data science and machine learning fields. Sometimes, I'll create **blog posts** with **code examples**. Hope this will be helpful for me and my fans. Thank you for visiting my web application!

All this will take time, so please be patient. Feel free to check out <a href = "https://medium.com/@ventsislav94" target = "_blank">my blog posts</a> at medium and to connect me at <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/ventsislav-yordanov/" target = "_blank">LinkedIn</a> if you want.
